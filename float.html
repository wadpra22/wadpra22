      The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However, due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, though it was not adapted into an anime episode. It also includes several horror adaption for example "The Line of no End", "The Horrible Elevator", "The Kindergarten Stairs", etc.
      Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) "Do you like green peppers?" (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as "How many times did you go to the police?" to tough-looking men or "How old are you?" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.
